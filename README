Imagination is a lightweight DVD slide show maker developed with GTK+2.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
Before packaging Imagination (unless this hasn't already been done) please comment line 223 in 
src/support.c and uncomment line 224. You should have like this:

//path = g_strdup("./transitions");
path = g_strconcat(PACKAGE_LIB_DIR,"/imagination",NULL);

Also for loading the transition's images comment line 255 and uncomment line 256. You should have like this:

filename = g_strdup_printf("%s/imagination/pixmaps/imagination-%d.png", DATADIR, GPOINTER_TO_INT( trans[2] ) );
//filename = g_strdup_printf( "./pixmaps/imagination-%d.png", GPOINTER_TO_INT( trans[2] ) );

If you fail to do so Imagination won't be able to load the transitions and the transition's images when
the package is installed.
