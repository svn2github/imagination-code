Imagination is a lightweight DVD slide show maker developed with GTK+2.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
Before packaging Imagination please comment line 223 in src/support.c and
remove the comment from line 224. You should have like this:

//path = g_strdup("./transitions");
path = g_strconcat(PACKAGE_LIB_DIR,"/imagination",NULL);

If you fail to do so Imagination won't be able to load the transitions when
the package is installed.
