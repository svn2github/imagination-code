Tasks that will hopefully be accomplished in this branch:
 - update Ken Burns editor
 - prepare infrastructure for video slides
 - prepare infrastructure for multiple subtitles per slide
 - convert any integer based durations to floating point
 - implement runtime configurable preview fps (should this be done in trunk??)
 - have fun breaking Imagination;)
